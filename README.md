# Weighted-Normalization

MATTEO MIGLIO

Machine Learning final Research paper into the benefits and drawbacks of using weight normalization in neural networks

This is an in house implementation of weighted normalization in order to boost the performance in classification of both an autoencoder and a 
linear + convoluted neural network
